Press the keys as they show up on screen, and DON'T LET GO!!

Well, until they go away :)

Available options:

   --no-music       Disables music. Use this if music doesn't play or plays as line noise.
   --no-sfx         Same for sound effects.

   --mykeyboardisawesome    Use this options if your keyboard has no key-locking bugs
                            (you can press any 4 keys simultaneously)


Have fun!
